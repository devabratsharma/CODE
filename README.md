# system requirement

Tensorflow 2.12.0 and Keras 2.12.0 packages with python 3.10.12 are used on google colab platform to construct the CNN regression model.

# installation guide

The above mention packages can be installed in a windows 10 operating system computer following standard installation procedure.
The installations will take about few minutes.

# Demo

The final CNN regression model along with the model architecture code is given in the code.zip file.
The required input files mentioned in the final version of the codes is made available in the code.zip file itself.
The expected output of the code is the forecast of normalized Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall anomaly between 1980 to 2023 at 5 and 18-months lead time.
The forecast between 1980 and 2011 (2012 to 2023) is generated using D20 anamoly from SODA version 2.2.4 (ORAS5).
The expected run time of the final CNN model in both google colab and windows 10 desktop is around few minutes.

# Instructions for use

Step wise instruction at appropriate locations are given in the scripts of the CNN regression models itself.
The dataset and code are arranged in a systematic order inside the code.zip file for user convenience. 

To run the codes, all the required input files (both validation input and output), weight parameters (fine_tune_*.hdf5), Sample.hdf5 file, and model script should be placed in the same folder.
